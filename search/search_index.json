Insider is able to detect code smells, the usage of external libraries and the topics that a software project approaches by only using Regex. This means that Insider does not use any type of parsing and is therefore language independent. Installation From Github To install Insider from Github, please download from the latest release from Github, the insider.zip archive and unzip it to a specific location. The contents of this archive are: * insider-*.jar - the executable jar file * insider.bat - a batch script for executing Insider on Windows * insider.sh - a shell script for executing insider on Windows * config - a folder for configuration files, described more in the Configuration Section * results - a folder where Insider will output the results. From Docker ... From Code Clone the repository from here . Run gradle clean build to obtain an executable jar. Configuration Edit the configuration file ( config/insider-conf.properties ), to specify the root folder of the project's sources. Commands Find Command In order to find the occurrences of the libraries in the analyzed project. Use the following command (run Insider using the insider.bat or insider.sh script): ```shell script insider.sh find config/libraries.json * Detect Simple Code Smells. Use the following command (run Insider using the **insider.bat** or **insider.sh** script): ```shell script insider.sh find config/code_smells.json You can also run the find command with both files at once: shell script insider.sh find config/libraries.json config/code_smells.json The commands will generate two .json files ( PROJECT_ID-libraries.json and PROJECT_ID-code_smells.json ) in the results folder.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#insider","text":"Insider is a belt of tools that, built on the idea of searching regular expressions in code.
